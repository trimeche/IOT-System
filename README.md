# IOT-System
ESP32-CAM And python openCv

Step Number 1 :

* Download the repository ESP32-CAM-Main 

* RUN THE CODE "WIFICAM"
  - change SSID and Password 
  - If you are working with the esp32-cam and arduino ,try to connect the pin : 
  
ESP32-CAM                   Arduino 
 3V3                      3.3V
 IOO -GND                  GND-Reset  
 UDT                       TX
 UDR                       RX


*  Have a link like :  'http://192.168.0.153/cam.bmp'


Step Number 2:

* Go to code Python : My code "ESP32-CAM-Python" 

###Very easy way to have a relation between the image detected from esp32-cam and the python OpenCV
